👋 Hi, I’m Clair

🏢 I used to improve the accessibility of products at [Unity](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies) but left the company and tech world entirely after being fired for standing up against discrimination.

🏫 Now I research accessibility in grad school. While academia has its (glaring) flaws, it is a great improvement and a better environment for disability advocacy.

🖋️ If **you'd** like to work with me, you can find me on [LinkedIn here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clairross/).

In my spare time, I like to...
- 🎮 Program games
- 🎲 Write and play tabletop games
- 🏳️‍🌈 Offer my time and energy to my community
