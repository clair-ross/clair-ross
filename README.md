👋 Hi, I’m Clair

🏢 I'm an ex-[Unity](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies) employee who was a part of the Accessibility team. ♿

I was fired due to calling out descrimination against the homeless populations of Vancouver, BC during a period of mass eviction multiple times over the coarse of a few months. The reason I was given was broking code of conduct, which is the exact code of conduct I criticized the day before being fired, exposing how it supports the white suprematist ideal of Right to Comfort and calling for others to help in re-writing it.

🖋️ If you'd like to work with someone who's passionate about social change and accessibility, who was given accolades by teammates and execs alike, you can find me on [LinkedIn here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clairross/)

In my spare time I like to...
- 🎮 Program games
- 🎲 Write and play table top games
- 🏳️‍🌈 Offer my time and energy to my community
